Learning How to Program with Examples in Clojure and Scala

This tutorial contains the excercises and notes of an introductory programming session with a high school student.

While there are many websites and tools for ["getting kids excited about programming"](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/10-tools-to-get-kids-excited-about-programming), we choose to try out this great tutorial: [Klipse for Kids](http://kids.klipse.tech).

Since this was a self-directed study on programming, this document carries many links to useful articles from [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/).

We chose [Clojure](https://clojure.org) and [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org) as the two languages to begin the learning process with a [Functional Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) paradigm.  Starting with two languages hase come quite naturally, since the student grew up bilingually ;-)  Clojure, as a modern LISP, is the language used on the "Klipse for Kids" website.  Doing the same coding excercises also in Scala, will later allow for a smooth incorporation of [Object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) concepts.
