## 1. Motivation: An Ever-Changing World of Languages?

_All languages change continually._  This gives rise to language families, often rendered as
["trees"](https://www.theguardian.com/education/gallery/2015/jan/23/a-language-family-tree-in-pictures).

___Questions:___

* What are the forces driving
  [_language change_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_change) (languages evolving) and
  [_language shift_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_shift) (people changing languages)?
* If languages not just split but influence each other, then how accurate is it to speak of a
  [_tree_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)) vs a
  [_graph_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) of languages?
* What are the advantages of being
  [multilingual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilingualism) or
  [polyglot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyglotism)?
* Do languages come in and out of fashion, as implied by
  ["Top 10 Programming Languages for 2017"](https://www.rinftech.com/top-10-programming-languages-2017), for example?
* In addition to learning the
  [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax) of a programming language, what's the importance
  [style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_style),
  [concepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_Concepts_in_Programming_Languages),
  [idioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiom) and
  [patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)?
