## 1. Motivation: An Ever-Changing World of Languages?

_All languages change continually._  For example:

* <https://www.theguardian.com/education/gallery/2015/jan/23/a-language-family-tree-in-pictures>
* <https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/01/27/this-beautiful-language-tree-shows-how-india-is-as-linguistically-diverse-as-europe>

___Questions:___

* What are the forces driving [_language change_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_change) (languages evolving) and [_language shift_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_shift) (people changing languages)?
* If different languages continually influence each other, then how accurate is it to speak of a language "tree" (instead of a "graph" of languages)?
* What's the relevance of knowing multiple languages?  Knowing at least one language really well?
* How important is the choice of the first language?  The choice of language concepts and programming paradigms?
