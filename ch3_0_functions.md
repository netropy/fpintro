## 3. Functions

In the previous chapter, we've learned how to form, evaluate, and name expressions.

So far, all names as introduced in the coding excercises represented constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_(computer_programming)), which could be used as [operands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operand) or [values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(computer_science)) in general, i.e., after an operator `(op ...)` in Closure or `op(...)` in Scala.

In this chapter we learn how to define "formulas" or [anonymous functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function), which describe computations in terms of [parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)).  Such functions may be given a name, and they can be "applied" like a user-defined [operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(computer_programming)).
